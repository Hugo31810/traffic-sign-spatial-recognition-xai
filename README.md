> **Comparative analysis of spatial invariance in Neural Networks and Explainable AI (XAI) for Autonomous Driving perception systems.**

This project quantifies the impact of **Inductive Bias** in Computer Vision architectures. It explores the catastrophic failure of **Dense Networks (MLP)** regarding **Spatial Invariance** compared to Convolutional Networks (CNN). The pipeline includes a custom "Shifted Dataset" generation to stress-test the models and utilizes **Grad-CAM** to audit the decision-making process, ensuring the model focuses on semantic features (pictograms) rather than contextual noise.

## 💡 Project Overview

In **Autonomous Driving**, a perception system must be robust against camera vibrations or misalignment. A stop sign is a stop sign, regardless of its position in the frame. This project empirically proves why the lack of spatial invariance in MLPs makes them unsuitable for raw pixel processing.

**Key Technical Capabilities:**

* **🛡️ Robustness Auditing:** Implementation of a custom data pipeline to create `ds2` (Shifted Dataset), rigorously testing translational invariance.
* **📊 Architecture Benchmarking:** A/B testing between MLP (Flattened input) and CNN (Spatial input) under stress conditions.
* **🧠 Explainable AI (XAI):** Integration of `pytorch-grad-cam` to generate Saliency Maps, verifying that the model learns the object's semantics and not background bias.
* **🔄 Data Augmentation Pipeline:** Using affine transformations to improve generalization on the validation set.

📊 The Dataset: GTSRB
The model was trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), a de-facto standard for multi-class image classification in Computer Vision. It presents a high challenge due to real-world variations such as varying light conditions, motion blur, and physical damage to the signs.

Classes: 43 distinct categories (Speed limits, Stop, Yield, Warnings, etc.).

Volume: >50,000 images (Train/Test split).

Resolution: Varying sizes (resized to 32x32 for this experiment).

## 🧪 Experiments & Results

The core experiment involved training models on centered data and testing them on spatially shifted data to measure **Generalization Capability**.

### 1. The "Shift" Hypothesis

We tested the hypothesis that **Dense Networks** overfit to specific pixel coordinates. A synthetic dataset (`ds2`) was created where traffic signs were randomly translated within the 32x32 canvas.

### 2. Quantitative Results

| Model Architecture | Inductive Bias | Test Accuracy (Shifted Data) | Technical Conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MLP (Dense)** | None | **~24.2%** ❌ | **Catastrophic Failure.** Flattening the input destroys spatial topology; the model treats shifted pixels as entirely new features. |
| **FCNN / CNN** | Spatial | **~83.5%** ✅ | **Robust.** Convolutional kernels share weights across the input, effectively detecting features regardless of position. |
